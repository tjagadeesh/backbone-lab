## Backbone Labs
This project will take you through the usage of backbone.js. To better explain and
to demonstrate the best practices for SPA, we have used RequireJS for dependency 
management at ui layer. Along with that for the time being we have created a 
restful web service using spring 3.2 mvc. In future we will be adding more such 
services and ui components.

Components:
* web - backbone-lab web context
* studentservice - JAX-RS web service
